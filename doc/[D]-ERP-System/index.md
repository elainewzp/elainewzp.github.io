### Background
The original ERP system could not support accurate inventory forecasting or manage the cash flow cycle, leading to overstock and chaotic procurement rhythms. The manufacturing factories were unable to manage operations effectively.



### Objective
Develop an ERP forecasting system that incorporates "payment cycle" logic to enable synchronized management of demand, sales, and capital flow.



### Actions
- Built a linked model for "Procurement–Warehousing–Sales–Payment Collection" and integrated it into the ERP system for rolling annual budget forecasting.
- Modeled inventory turnover using time-series data at both regional and SKU levels to identify redundant stock.



### Results
- Improved inventory forecasting accuracy.
- Reduced warehousing costs by 30%.
- Controlled product profit margins between 20–30%.
