# Background
>The traditional ERP system lacked the ability to generate accurate inventory forecasts or manage cash flow cycles effectively. This resulted in frequent overstocking, chaotic procurement schedules, and inefficiencies in manufacturing operations. Factories struggled to synchronize demand, sales, and capital flow, limiting overall business performance.



# Why do this
>1. **Solve Inefficiencies**  the company needed an ERP forecasting system that could integrate the entire “Procurement–Warehousing–Sales–Payment” cycle into one predictive model.<br><br>
>2. **Improve Forecast Accuracy**  to optimize inventory turnover, reduce costs, and ensure stable profit margins across product lines.<br><br>
>3. **Better Management**  Advanced tools help managers manage their teams more effectively with clear personal KPIs and goals. Additionally, this prevents over-investment in products that are out of demand in the market.<br><br>


# Actions

>1. **Redesign ERP System**  Designed and implemented a linked ERP forecasting model that incorporated procurement, warehousing, sales, and payment collection, enabling rolling annual budget forecasting.<br><br>
>2. **Time-series Product Management**  Applied time-series forecasting methods to analyze SKU- and region-level inventory turnover, identifying redundant stock and optimizing procurement planning.<br><br>
>3. **Combine Cash-flow Cycle**  Upgraded the ERP framework with cash-flow cycle logic, integrating multiple data streams (procurement, inventory, sales, payment) into one predictive system for end-to-end visibility.<br><br>



# Results
>- Improved forecast accuracy, enabling synchronized management of demand, sales, and capital flow
>- Reduced warehousing costs by 30% through better inventory turnover control.
>- Maintained stable profitability with controlled product margins between 20–30%.
